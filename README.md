# d3d9.dll Preloader  
Author: Sean Pesce

Simple d3d9.dll wrapper used by programs to load d3d9.dll from the system directory instead of the local directory to circumvent any existing d3d9.dll wrappers that may cause incompatibility issues (such as PvP Watchdog for Dark Souls). This wrapper does not modify or add to the functionality of the original d3d9.dll.
